LambdaLog and all of my open source projects take time and money to maintain. Any contribution you can make will help keep this project and many more alive by:

- Allowing myself to allocate more time to my open source projects.
- Help pay for hosting, domains, software, and hardware needed for my open source projects.
- Providing the caffeine needed.
- Just knowing one of my projects made your life easier.

I know that not everyone has the cash to spare so there are [other ways you can help contribute](/docs/[v]/contributing) and is just as much appreciated!
