title: Silent Mode
description: Disable log messages when you don't need them.
---

There may be cases where you want to disable your log messages from being outputted to the console, such as during testing. LambdaLog provides a `silent` configuration option that will prevent messages from being written to the console.

!> With silent mode enabled, your log messages will still be generated but not outputted to the console. This allows for more advanced functionality if needed.

### Enabling Silent Mode
Depending on how you are implementing LambdaLog into your project, you can enable this option easily.

<!--tabs-->
#### Default Instance
```js
const log = require('lambda-log');

// Enable silent mode
log.options.silent = true;
```

#### New Instance
```js
const { LambdaLog } = require('lambda-log');

const log = new LambdaLog({
  // Enable silent mode
  silent: true
});

// You can still disable it later in your process with:
log.options.silent = false;
```
<!--/tabs-->
